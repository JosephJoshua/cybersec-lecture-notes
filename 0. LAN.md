A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices that can share data.
The **internet** is a network of networks.
#### LAN Topologies
The physical or logical layout of a LAN.
- **Bus Topology**
	- All devices share a single common communication line (the bus).
	- Simple but inefficient, as only one device can transmit at a time, and a break in the main cable can take down the entire network.
- **Ring Topology**
	- Devices are connected in a circle, with data passing from one device to the next until it reaches its destination.
	- More orderly than a bus but can have a single point of failure if one device goes down.
- **Star Topology**
	- All devices are connected to a central point, like a switch or hub. 
	- The dominant model for modern LANs because it is robust; a failure in one cable or device doesn't affect the others.

1. **Client -> Server: SYN** 
	- Contains a random initial sequence number (ISN), let's say `Seq=X`.
	- "I'd like to start a conversation. I'll start numbering my bytes at X."
2. **Server -> Client: [SYN, ACK]**
	-  The server receives the request. 
	- Contains its own random initial sequence number (`Seq=Y`) and acknowledges the client's number by setting the acknowledgment field to one more than what it received (`Ack=X+1`).
	- "I hear you! I'll start my bytes at Y, and I'm ready for your byte X+1."
3. **Client -> Server: ACK**
	- Acknowledges the server's sequence number (`Ack=Y+1`).
	- "I got your message. Let's talk."
At this point, the connection is established, and data transfer can begin.

**Graceful connection release**:

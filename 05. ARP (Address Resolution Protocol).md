Links layer 3 IPs to layer 2 MACs on a local network.

#### ARP Packets
- **Hardware Type:** e.g., Ethernet (1).
- **Protocol Type:** e.g., IPv4 (`0x0800`).
- **Hardware Address Length:** e.g., 6 bytes for MAC.
- **Protocol Address Length:** e.g., 4 bytes for IPv4.
- **Opcode:** Request (1) or Reply (2).
- **Sender & Target Hardware Addresses (MACs).**
- **Sender & Target Protocol Addresses (IPs).**

#### ARP Cache Poisoning and Man-in-the-middle (MITM)
Exploits the fact that hosts accept unsolicited ARP replies.
By sending forged ARP replies, the attacker can trick a victim and a gateway into mapping each other's IP addresses to the attacker's MAC address, thus redirecting all traffic through the attacker's machine.

- **Defenses:**
    - **Static ARP Entries**
	    - Manually setting a permanent entry in the ARP table (`arp -s <IP> <MAC>`).
	    - Only manageable in very small, static networks.
    - **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**
	    - Switch feature that works with DHCP Snooping.
	    - Maintains a trusted database of IP-to-MAC bindings. If an ARP packet arrives on a port with a binding that doesn't match the database, the switch drops the packet.

The dominant **protocol** used is the TCP/IP protocol, consisting of:
1. **Application**: where user-facing applications operate.
	- Web browser (HTTP), email client (SMTP), DNS, etc.
2. **Transport**: manages the connection between two devices.
	- TCP (reliable, ordered delivery), UDP (fast, best-effort delivery).
3. **Network**: global addressing and routing using **IP addresses** to get a **packet** from the source network to the destination network.
4. **Link**: communication on the local network segment using **MAC addresses** to deliver a **frame** to a specific device on LAN.

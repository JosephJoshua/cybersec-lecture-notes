An Ethernet frame wraps an Internet Layer packet (like an IP packet) with a header and trailer.
- **Ethernet II**
	- Dominant format used today.
	- Identified by a 2-byte `EtherType` field that has a value of `0x0800` or greater. This field directly indicates the protocol of the encapsulated payload (e.g., `0x0800` for IPv4, `0x0806` for ARP).
- **IEEE 802.3**
	- An older standard.
	- In the same position as the `EtherType` field, it has a 2-byte `Length` field. If the value of this field is less than `0x0600`, the receiving station knows it indicates the length of the data payload, not the protocol type.

An Ethernet switch (Layer 2) is the traffic controller of a local network.
Its goal is to forward data frames only to their intended recipient.

A switch stores a MAC Address Table, implemented with a Content-Addressable Memory (**CAM**; offers high-speed lookups).
- Provide the data (MAC address) and it gives back the location (switch port number).
- Entry: (MAC address, port number, aging timer)

#### Algorithm
1. **Learn**: updates CAM table with **source MAC address** (resets aging timer).
2. Examines **destination MAC address**:
	1. **Forward** (unicast): if the dest. is known and on a *different* port, send the frame to that port.
	2. **Filter**: if the dest. is on the same port, drop the frame.
	3. **Flood**: if the dest. is unknown or is the **broadcast address** (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`), send a copy out to every port (except source).

- Automates the assignment of IP addresses and network configurations.
- Operates over UDP.
- Clients send to port 67 (DHCP server).
- Servers reply to port 68 (DHCP client).

**DORA** process:
1. **Discover**: a client without an IP address needs to find a DHCP server.
	- Broadcasts a `DHCPDISCOVER` message.
	- Packet has `xid` (random transaction ID) and `chaddr` (client hardware/MAC address).
- **Offer**: all DHCP servers on the LAN receive the message.
	- Responds with a unicast `DHCPOFFER` message.
	- Packet has `xid` (must match request), `yiaddr` (“your” IP address), `Options` (subnet mask, default gateway IP, DNS server IPs, lease duration).
- **Request**: client chooses one offer.
	- Broadcasts a `DHCPREQUEST` message, so unchosen servers also know that they’re rejected.
	- Packet has `xid` (again, must match request), `Requested IP address`, `Server Identifier` (IP address of DHCP sever).
- **Acknowledge**: finalizes the transaction.
	- Sends a unicast `DHCPACK` message.
	- Packet has `xid` (must match request), `yiaddr` (“your” IP address), `Options` (subnet mask, default gateway IP, DNS server IPs, lease duration).

**Renew**:
- When 50% of the lease time has expired (T1 timer), the client will send a unicast `DHCPREQUEST` directly to the server to ask for a renewal. 
- If the server is available, it responds with a `DHCPACK` to extend the lease.

**Release:**
When a client is shut down gracefully, it should send a `DHCPRELEASE` message to the server.

#### DHCP Vulnerabilities
Lacks authentication, like ARP.
- **DHCP Starvation**: attacker exhausts the server’s IP pool with spoofed, continuous requests.
- **DHCP Spoofing**: rogue server provides malicious configuration (e.g. a malicious gateway/DNS server).
- **Defense (DHCP Snooping)**:
	- Feature on switches that allows an admin to designate ports as “trusted” or “untrusted”.
	- Switch will drop DHCP offer packets from those ports.

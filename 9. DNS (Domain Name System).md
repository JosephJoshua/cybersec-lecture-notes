Before DNS, name-to-address mapping was done with `HOSTS.TXT`.

- **Domain Structure**
	- A domain name like `www.tsinghua.edu.cn` is a series of labels read from right to left, corresponding to a tree structure starting from the root (`.`).![[Pasted image 20250707024347.png]]
- **DNS Zones**
	- A zone is a portion of the domain name space managed by a specific entity.
	- For example, Tsinghua University manages the `tsinghua.edu.cn` zone. A zone contains all the **resource records** for the domains within it.
	  ![[Pasted image 20250707024603.png]]
- **Resource Records (RR)**
		- Entries in the DNS database. Common types include: `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, and `NS`.

- **Root Servers**
	- The 13 logical root server IPs are the starting point for all DNS lookups.
	- **Anycast** allows these IPs to be announced from hundreds of physical locations around the world. This means a query is automatically directed to the nearest physical root server.

- **Recursive Resolver (Caching Server)**
	- The server a computer talks to directly (e.g., `8.8.8.8` or an ISP's server).
	- Doesn't own any DNS records itself.
	- Act as a proxy and perform the entire lookup process on behalf of the client.
- **Authoritative Name Server**
	- Holds the actual, official DNS records for a specific zone.
	- For example, Tsinghua University runs the authoritative name servers for the `tsinghua.edu.cn` zone.
	- Only knows how to answer questions about the zones it manages.
	  
**Iterative query** process performed by a recursive resolver for `www.tsinghua.edu.cn`:
1. **Client to Resolver**
	- Computer sends a **recursive query** to its configured resolver.
	- "What is the IP for `www.tsinghua.edu.cn`?"
	- The `RD` (Recursion Desired) flag in the DNS header is set to 1.
2. **Resolver to Root**
	- The resolver checks its cache.
	- Assuming the record is not cached, it begins the process by sending an **iterative query** to one of the 13 Root Servers.
	- "Who is the name server for `.cn`?"
3. **Root Response (Referral)**
	- The Root Server doesn't know the answer for `www.tsinghua.edu.cn`, but it knows who manages `.cn`.
	- Responds with a _referral_ containing the `NS` records for the `.cn` Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers.
4. **Resolver to TLD**
	- The resolver follows the referral and sends an iterative query to one of the `.cn` TLD servers.
	- "Who is the name server for `edu.cn`?"
5. **TLD Response (Referral)**
	- The `.cn` server responds with another referral, pointing to the `NS` records for the `edu.cn` zone.
6. **Resolver to Second-Level Domain**
	- The resolver again follows the referral and queries an `edu.cn` server.
	- "Who is the name server for `tsinghua.edu.cn`?"
7. **Second-Level Response (Referral)**
	- The `edu.cn` server responds with a final referral, pointing to the `NS` records for `tsinghua.edu.cn` (Tsinghua's own servers).
8. **Resolver to Authoritative Server**
	- The resolver sends a final iterative query to one of Tsinghua's authoritative name servers.
	- "What is the `A` record for `www.tsinghua.edu.cn`?"
9. **Authoritative Response (Answer)**
	- This server holds the zone file and has the final answer.
	- It responds with the `A` record containing the IP address.
	- The `AA` (Authoritative Answer) flag in the response header is set to 1.
10. **Resolver to Client**
	- The resolver receives the final answer, stores it in its local cache for the duration of the record's Time-To-Live (TTL), and finally sends the answer back to the computer.

#### DNS Packet Format
Consists of a 12-byte header followed by four variable-length sections.
![[Pasted image 20250707030317.png]]

**DNS Header**:
- **Transaction ID (TXID) (16 bits):** A random identifier to match queries with responses.
- **Flags (16 bits):** Control bits like `QR` (Query/Response), `AA` (Authoritative Answer), and `RD` (Recursion Desired).
- **RCODE (Response Code) (4 bits):** Indicates the result (e.g., `0` for No Error, `3` for `NXDOMAIN`).
- **Section Counts (4 x 16 bits):** Counts for the number of records in each of the following sections.

**DNS Message Sections**:
1. **Question Section:** The domain name and record type being queried.
2. **Answer Section:** Contains records that directly answer the query.
3. **Authority Section:** Contains NS records pointing to authoritative servers.
4. **Additional Section:** Contains "glue" records, like the IP addresses of the servers in the Authority section.

#### The Kaminsky Attack (2008)
- Instead of attacking a real domain, it queries for a _non-existent_ random subdomain (`random123.victim-bank.com`).
- The attacker then floods the resolver with forged responses.
- The malicious payload doesn't answer the random query but instead uses the **Authority Section** to claim that the attacker's server is now the authoritative server for the _entire_ parent domain (`victim-bank.com`).
- When the resolver accepts this, its cache is poisoned.

#### DNS Defenses
- **Source Port Randomization**
	- The primary defense against the Kaminsky attack, making the TXID and port much harder to guess.
- **DNS-0x20 / Case Randomization**
	- The resolver randomizes the capitalization of the letters in the domain name it queries (e.g., `wWw.TsingHua.eDu.Cn`).
	- Since DNS lookups are case-insensitive but responses are case-preserving, the resolver can check if the case in the response matches the query it sent.
	- This adds extra bits of entropy for an attacker to guess, making spoofing harder.
- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**
	- The true cryptographic solution.
	- Adds digital signatures to DNS records, creating a chain of trust from the root down to the final answer.
	- Uses `RRSIG` (the signature), `DNSKEY` (the public key), and `DS` (a hash of the key in the parent zone) records to ensure data authenticity and integrity.
- **Modern Privacy Enhancements**
    - **DNS over TLS (DoT):** Encrypts DNS queries over a TLS tunnel on port 853.
    - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH):** Encapsulates DNS queries within standard HTTPS traffic on port 443, making it hard to block or monitor.
